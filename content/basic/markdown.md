footnote
```
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

code block
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

fenced code block
The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create code blocks by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you’ll use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block. The best part? You don’t have to indent any lines!

code block inside list item
one empty line after the list item, then ident one tab, then idented (again) code block or fenced code block
